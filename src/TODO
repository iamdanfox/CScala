Deal with sharing (or not) within the [Un]Shared(In|Out)Port traits (to avoid
duplicated code).

Test files: Test.scala Phils.scala EightQueens.scala

Restrictions:

An alt may not have two simultaneously enabled branches using the
same channel. (see mail to Bernard 01/09/2010)

If a port is used within an alt, it can't simultaneously be used within a
non-alt (fixing this requires changing the semantics, so that the alt does the
read or write).

The input port of a OneMany channel may not simultaneously
participate in more than one \SCALA{alt}

Can't use alts with:
- buffers (BufImpl.scala)
- netIO (Connection.scala, ObjectIO)
- proxies (InPort.scala, OutPort.scala)
(not implemented).
