/**
== Decription ==

An analogue of NetIO that uses Datagrams as transport. 
Connections are still bidirectional, but they are not
considered to be streamed. Messages between the
same pair of sockets may overtake each other. Messages may
also be dropped.

The Server object returned from clientConnection is used
to send a Client's ''requests'' to a server; the same Server
object is used to read the server's ''replies.''

The Client objects returned from serverConnection provide
clients' requests together with the addresses that they
came from; they accept replies that are annotated with
the addresses to which they should be sent.

The implementation is designed in such a way that the
connections can participate in `alt`s.  

The following is an extract from a very simple client that stops
when the server it is connected to sends it a zero. 
{{{
   val server = Datagram.clientConnection[int,int](length, host, port)
   val n      = 10
   repeat (n!=0)
   { server ! n
     server ? { case m => n=m }
   }
}}}
        
The following is an extract from a very simple server, that subtracts
1 from each number it is sent, and returns the result to the client
that sent it.
{{{
   val clients = Datagram.serverConnection[int,int](length, port)
   repeat  
   { client ? match
             { case (n, theClient)  => client!(n-1, theClient)  }
   }
   client.close
}}}

=== HISTORY ===
Rewritten in late August 2012 to better handle transmission errors and socket timeouts.

At present there is almost no support for dealing cleanly with a socket timeout, or
other `IOException`. All that happens is that the CSO channels connected to the datagram
connection are closed; as is the connection itself.
