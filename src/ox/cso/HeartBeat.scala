/**
This module provides the simplest possible implementation of
adapters that can be used to transform an ordinary buffer Into
a ''heartbeat'' buffer. The receiving end of such a buffer is
capable of discovering that the sending end is no longer (capable
of being) in contact with it.

The method is simple: the transmitting end guarantees to send
something along the channel periodically: either a ''ping''
message or a message containing real data. If the receiving
end doesn't receive anything for (slightly more than) one period,
then it decides that the sending end has ''gone down''.
