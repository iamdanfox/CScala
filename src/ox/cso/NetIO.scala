/**
  These utilities implement cso <code>Connection</code>s that
  transmit data to and from the network.  A synchronous connection
  is one that transmits data to the network as soon as it is
  available.  More precisely, if <code>conn</code> is a synchronous
  connection, then <code>conn!v</code> transmits <code>v</code> to
  the network immediately (without buffering), and terminates as
  soon as that has been done.  It is important to understand that
  a <code>conn!v</code> in one virtual machine does not necessarily
  synchronise with the corresponding <code>conn?</code> connected
  to the corresponding port in a peer virtual machine.
