/**
A <code>[Req,Rep]</code> process-farmer is primed with a collection of 
<code>[Req,Rep]</code> interfaces to worker-servers. It dispatches 
each request that arrives from its client (or on its input port) to the next
free worker. When a response is returned from a worker, it
is forwarded by the farmer to the client (or to the farmer's output port).
In short, it acts as a client to its servers, and as a server to
its clients.
