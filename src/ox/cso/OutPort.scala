    An <code>OutPort[T]</code> is one of the endpoints of a channel that transmits
    values of type <code>T</code>.
    
    If <code>T &lt;: T'</code> then <code>OutPort[T'] &lt;:
    OutPort[T]</code> -- so we can only ever send subtypes of
    <code>T</code> down a channel with an <code>OutPort[T]</code>,
    no matter how we (type consistently) alias its output port.
    
    If <code>p</code> is an <code>OutPort[T]</code>, then
    <pre><code>p -!-&gt; { command }</code></pre> denotes
    an <code>OutPort.Event</code> that can be used
    in an <b>alt</b>; the <code>command</code> must
    normally output to <code>p</code>. 
    
    Likewise, if <code>guard</code> 
    is a Boolean expression, then 
    <pre><code>( guard &amp;&amp;&amp; p ) -!-&gt; { command }</code></pre>
    is a guarded output event that is enabled when <code>guard</code>
    is true and <code>p</code> is open. 
    
    Such events are ready to 
    fire within an <b>alt</b> when outputting to <code>p</code> would 
    not cause the currently-running process to have to wait. 
    
    <b>Design Rules:</b> (see the <b>[Restrictions]</b> section
    of <b>Alt</b>)
