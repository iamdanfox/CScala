/**
  A <code>Process</code> is effectively a procedure that may be
  run in the current thread, may be forked to run in a thread
  separate from the current thread, or may be composed 
  with another <tt>Process</tt> to form a parallel composite process.
    <p>
    <code>p.fork</code>   
                starts the process <code>p</code> as a new thread and
                returns the corresponding <code>ThreadHandle</code>
    
    <p>
    <code>p.forkdaemon</code>  
                starts the process <code>p</code> as a new daemon thread and
                returns the corresponding <code>ThreadHandle</code>
    
    <p>
    <code>p()</code>      
                runs the body of the process <code>p</code> in
                the invoking thread.  
    <p>
    <code>p || q</code>  
                represents a composite process that terminates when <code>p</code>
                and <code>q</code> have terminated (either cleanly
                or by throwing an uncaught exception). When it is
                started, <code>p</code> runs in the invoking thread,
                and <code>q</code> runs in a separate thread.
                <ul>
                <li>
                If neither component terminates with an exception
                then the composite terminates cleanly.
                </li>
                <li>
                If one component terminates with a non-<tt>Stop</tt>
                exception then the composite re-throws that exception when
                they have both terminated. 
                </li>
                <li>
                If both components terminate with 
                non-<tt>Stop</tt> exceptions then a <tt>ParException</tt>
                is raised which embodies them both. 
                </li>
                <li>
                If both
                components terminate with <tt>Stop</tt> exceptions
                then a <tt>Stop</tt> exception is raised. 
                </li>
                </ul>
  <p>
  If a process terminates with a non-<tt>Stop</tt> exception then
  a stack backtrace will be printed, unless there is a
  java runtime property named <tt>ox.cso.process.traceexception</tt>
  with value <tt>off</tt>.

/** 
    ThreadHandle is the factory object for ThreadHandles.  If the
    runtime system property <code>ox.cso.pool</code> is set,
    to a number > 0 then threads are pooled; if
    it is left unset, then threads are pooled and kept alive 
    for 4 seconds, otherwise whenever a thread is needed
    to execute a process it is obtained by constructing a new one.
    <p>
    It is not necessary to use pooled threads in a CSO program, but
    it can make some programs run considerably faster -- particularly
    those that use very many short-lived processes.
    <p>
    The price of using pooled threads is that at the end of the
    program execution there can be a delay while the pooled threads
    that are currently unused drop out of the pool. 
    The method <code>CSO.exit</code> speeds this up 
    when threads are pooled. It should be called as the last thing a 
    CSO program does.
    <p>
    
    If the value of the runtime JVM property <code>ox.cso.pool</code> 
    is a positive number, then the keepalive time for idle pooled threads is
    set to that number of seconds; if it is unset, or set but is not a number, then 
    a default period (4 seconds) is used; if it is set to zero
    then threads are not pooled.
