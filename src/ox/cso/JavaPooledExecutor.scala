/**
A pooled thread-execution mechanism that uses the standard java utility thread pool.

This was constructed in order to demonstrate a mysterious bug with threading in 
the Mac OS/X Lion Java thread implementation that doesn't seem to be there in 
OS/X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). 

The method of specifying pooling is documented in `ThreadHandle`.
