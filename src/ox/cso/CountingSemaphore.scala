/**
A <tt>CountingSemaphore(permits_)</tt> is primed with <tt>permits_</tt> virtual tokens.

A call of <code>acquire</code> removes a token from the semaphore, providing
there is at least one left; otherwise it suspends the process that
invoked <code>acquire</code> until a token is available. 

A call of <code>release</code> releases a token. 
A call of <code>forceAcquires</code> releases all waiting <code>acquire</code>s,
and sets the <code>forced</code> flag. A semaphore can be forced at most once.
