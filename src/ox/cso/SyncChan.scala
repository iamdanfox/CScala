/**
  
  An (Occam-style) synchronised Chan implementation that ensures that
  <code>!</code> synchronises with <code>?</code>, and that performs a
  sound (but incomplete) dynamic check for inappropriate channel-end 
  sharing.
  <p>
  If a writer overtakes a waiting writer or a reader overtakes a waiting
  reader, then an IllegalStateException is thrown, for in this case at
  least two processes must be sharing an end of the channel. This is
  something that the Scala type system can't protect from. Even worse:
  given a fast enough reader, multiple writers can go undetected (the
  dual statement is also true).
  <p>
  To <i>share</i> neither end of a synchronized channel use
  a <code>OneOne</code>.
  <p>
  To <i>share</i> the writer end of a synchronized channel use
  a <code>ManyOne</code>.
  <p>
  To <i>share</i> the reader end of a synchronized channel use
  a <code>OneMany</code>.
  <p>
  To <i>share</i> both ends of a synchronized channel use
  a <code>ManyMany</code>, but
  if (in this case) you're sure that you don't need
  synchronization, merely <i>serialization</i> 
  then use a <code>Buf</code> (which should probably have been called
  a <code>ManyManyBuf</code>).
