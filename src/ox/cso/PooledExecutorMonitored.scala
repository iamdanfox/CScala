package ox.cso
import  scala.collection.mutable.Queue

/**
        A pooled-thread execution mechanism that keeps its server threads around
        for <code>keepSecs</code> seconds after they become idle.
        If <code>isDaemon</code> is true, then the threads that are
        made have their daemon bit set before being started.
        <p>
        If the runtime JVM property <code>ox.cso.pool.instrument</code> is
        <code>1</code> then when the JVM terminates a report will be
        made on the error stream indicating the extent to which 
        pooled threads were used.
        <p>
        If the value of the runtime JVM property <code>ox.cso.pool</code> 
        is a positive number, then the keepalive time for idle pooled threads is
        set to that number of seconds; if it is unset, or set but is not a number, then 
        a default period (4 seconds) is used; if it is set to zero
        then threads are not pooled. 
        
        Almost the same as PooledExecutor but organised as a monitor
        with everything synchronized on the pool itself. This in 
        order to chase a misfunction that (right now) has only been
        detected in an OSX 10.7 JVM.
