/**


== Alt Commands ==
`Alt` objects provide the core of
the implementation of CSO commands of the '''alt''' family, namely:
'''alt''', '''serve''', '''prialt''', '''priserve'''
and the `Alt` constructors can be invoked by a variety
of CSO notations.

}}}

The preferred notation is
{{{
    altcommand ( events
               | events
               | events
               ...
               | events
               )
}}}

where '''events''' is either a simple event or an event sequence constructed
using the notation
{{{              
    | (for ( variable <- collection ) yield simpleeventexpression(variable))  
}}}

In fact, an `Alt` is a function-like object constructed from a sequence of guarded
`Alt.Event`s (of which the most familiar kind are `InPort.Event`s
and `OutPort.Event`s). 

A simple `InPort.Event` usually takes one of the forms: 
{{{
   inport (guard)     ==> { bv => cmd }                     // deprecated  
   (guard &&& inport) ==> { bv => cmd } 
   inport             ==> { bv => cmd }
}}}

(in the third form the guard is implicitly `true`.)

Whenever the guard is true <i>and the port is open</i>, the
event is said to be enabled. When the port of an enabled event
is ready to read (''i.e.'' when a process at the 
other end of port's channel is prepared to cimmit
to writing), the event is said to be ready.  We <i>fire</i>
such an event by evaluating the expression 
{{{
        { bv => cmd }(inport?)
}}}
''i.e.'' we read a value from the port, then apply the function 
{{{
        { bv => cmd }
}}}
to that value.


Additional simple `InPort.Event`s take the form:
{{{
   inport (guard)     ==>> { bv => cmd }                  // deprecated   
   (guard &&& inport) ==>> { bv => cmd } 
   inport             ==>> { bv => cmd }
}}} 

(in the third form the guard is implicitly `true`.)

We ''fire''
this kind of event by evaluating the expression 
{{{
        (inport?{ bv => cmd })
}}}
''i.e.'' we perform an extended rendezvous read from the port.


== Primitive Event Notation ==
The above forms are syntactic sugar for events built using
the following more primitive notation, in which the `command`
is required to read from the `inport`.
{{{
   inport (guard)     -?-> { command }              //deprecated
   (guard &&& inport) -?-> { command } 
   inport             -?-> { command }
}}} 
(the operator `-->` is a synonym for `-?->`).
The `command` '''must''' input from the `inport`.  

== Timeouts and Failures ==
There are also two forms of ''pseudo-event'', namely:
{{{
   after(expression) ==> { cmd } 
   orelse            ==> { cmd }
}}} 
  
When `f: Alt` is applied, as `f()`, (this is done automatically
in the case of a CSO command of the '''alt''' family)
the guards are first
evaluated (in the case of an after guard, the Long-valued expression
is evaluated and determines a timeout in milliseconds). 
If any of the enabled events is ready, then one of them
is chosen (nondeterministically), and the event is fired.  
(See '''Fairness'')

If no enabled event is ready, then the current thread/process
is descheduled until one becomes ready.

If no event is enabled, or if they all become disabled while
the thread is suspended [See Note 2], then an `Abort` `Stop`
exception is thrown (unless the `Alt` has an
`orelse` event associated with it, in which case
that event's command is executed.


If a timeout event is specified with an 
{{{
    after(expression)==>{cmd}
}}}
guard, and the timeout elapses before any other
event becomes ready, then the timeout command is executed.

== OutPort Events ==
Although they do not appear in classical '''occam''', CSO also implements
output port events which can also participate in `Alt`s.
{{{
   outport (guard)     -!-> { command }              //deprecated
   (guard &&& outport) -!-> { command } 
   outport             -!-> { command }
}}}
Such events are ready when a process 
is committed to read from the other end of the
`outport`'s channel.  The `{command}` '''must'''
output to the `outport`.

See the documentation of `OutPort` for further details.

== Restrictions ==

  -   Guards must be side-effect free; as must the timeout 
      specification expression in an `after` event.
  
  -   No  more than one `after` event may appear.
  
  -   No  more than one `orelse` event may appear.
  
  
  -   If a shared port (e.g. of a ManyMany channel, whose ports can
      be shared by several senders and by several receivers)
      is involved in an alt, it must not simultaneously be read
      or written by a non-alt process;  

  -   An alt may not have two simultaneously enabled branches
      using the same channel (although it may have two branches
      using the same channel with disjoint guards);
        


== Fairness ==
This implementation is ''fair'' inasmuch as
successive applications of the same `Alt` object in
which the same collection of events turn out to be ready result
in distinct events being fired.
''Fairness'' is implemented in a non priority alt by starting the
scan for a ready port just after the most recently-selected port.

== Soundness of the Implementation ==
The current implementation (and a proof of its probabilistic soundness) is 
presented in ''Implementing Generalised Alt: A
Case Study in Validated Design using CSP'', Gavin Lowe.
