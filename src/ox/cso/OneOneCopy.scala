/**
  
  A finitely buffered point-to-point Chan implementation with partial
  dynamic enforcement of the point-to-point restriction. Conditions
  that will be detected dynamically and cause an exception to be
  thrown are: more than one output process attempting to write to
  a buffer that is already full, and more than one input process
  attempting to read from an empty buffer.
  
  '''DEPRECATED''': use `OneOneBuf`
